# UC_Tendency
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosed primarily in young individuals. The disease burden has increased with globalization; newly industrialized countries show the greatest increase in incidence and the highest prevalence is recorded in Western countries.

Complex diseases such as UC, present highly heterogeneous genotypes, which difficult for biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using multiple classifiers can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict UC genes.

A greater understanding of the gene expression in UC patients driving clinical and mucosal severity and response to therapy, and the clinical translation of these data, is needed to proactively identify targeted therapeutic approaches.
